RXWTITLE, Version 1.2.

Author: Michel SUCH. Email: msuch@free.fr



RXWTITLE.REX contains two rexx functions you can use in your rexx scripts to
manipulate the title that appears in the switchlist (window list) while your
script is running. It can be used, in long running scripts, to indicate
progress of the job.

You can include rxwtitle.rex in your rexx script without any change to the
original script since all variable used in rxwtitle are local.
Note: The rxwtitle.exe program must be located in one of the directories
defined in the path variable of the system or in the directory containing your
script.
rxwtitle.exe requires installation of emxrt 09.d to run.

- cur_title: returns the current title of the window.
Example:
win_title = cur_title()
If win_title = '' then probably the rxwtitle.exe was not found.


- find_rxwtitle: Internal function used to locate
the rxwtitle.exe program.
