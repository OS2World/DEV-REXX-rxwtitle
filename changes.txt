RXWTITLE 1.0: 2001-05-07.

Initial version.


RXWTITLE 1.1, 2001-05-09

- Somme minor changes in the rxwtitle.exe program to clean it up.

- Some changes in the documentation file to be more clear on what the program is
supposed to do.

- no change in the rxwtitle.rexx, so no change to
your rexx code.


RXWTITLE 1.2, 2001-12-05

- When the original title was restored, it was uppercased: fixed. This
causes some changes in the rxwtitle.rex so, if you included it in your code,
you must replace it by the new one.

- Recompiled the rxwtitle.exe changing compile flags which makes
smaller code.
